Functional Testing

User Registration and Authentication

Verify that user registration and authentication work seamlessly across different mobile devices and OS.
Ensure users can successfully create accounts with all required information.


Photo Posting with Filters

Check the ability to post photos with various filters and ensure that the filters are applied correctly.


User Search Functionality

Validate the functionality of user search.


Likes and Comments

Test the ability to like and comment on photos.


Stories and Live Streaming

Verify the functionality of stories and live streaming.


UI Testing

Ensure the interface is user-friendly and intuitive, meeting all design standards and requirements.
Check compatibility of the interface with various devices and screen sizes.



Security Testing

Verify mechanisms for protecting user personal data.
Test authentication mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities in registration and authentication processes, access rights management, and access to personal data.
Check for vulnerabilities like SQL injections, data interception, and session attacks.



Stability / Reliability Testing

Conduct failover tests to ensure the system correctly handles errors and recovers from them.
Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle the expected number of users and activities.


Compatibility Testing

Test compatibility with different versions of mobile devices and their operating systems.
Ensure user registration and authentication work smoothly on various devices and software.


Integration Testing

Check the interaction between different functions, such as comments and likes on stories.
Validate the correctness of function interactions during simultaneous use, such as sending comments during a live stream.
Test the integration of user registration and authentication with other system components.


Performance Testing

Conduct performance testing to assess the speed and responsiveness of registration and authentication processes under heavy user load.
Test scalability to ensure the system can handle increasing numbers of registrations and authentication requests without performance degradation.
Perform speed tests to ensure the system operates quickly enough.
Execute load optimization tests to ensure functions work efficiently with a large number of users.


Regression Testing

Perform regression testing to ensure any changes or updates do not introduce new issues or disrupt existing functionality.

Re-check previously tested scenarios to confirm their operability after modifications.
